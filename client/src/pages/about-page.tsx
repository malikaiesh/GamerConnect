              <p>
                GameZone was founded in 2022 by a team of gaming enthusiasts who saw the need for a comprehensive online
                gaming platform that offered both casual and competitive gaming experiences. What started as a small
                collection of browser games has grown into a diverse library of titles across multiple genres and platforms.
